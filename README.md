#### What does this project do?

   This project was developed in C language by referring to the avoid star game.
   This game can score points by avoiding and matching missile.
   By implementing each function as a function, code is relatively easy to recognize and language can be learned    interestingly through output results.
    
#### Why is this project useful?
    
   The reason why this project is useful is that it does not have a function that is actually helpful to people,    but I think it is useful for people who want to learn the language interestingly. 
   It is difficult to learn a language, but especially since shooting games have a large moving path, the output    results make it easier to understand and I think it can lower the language's high entry barrier.

#### How do I get started?

   1. Clone this Git repository in your repository.
   2. Copy and paste the source code into the desired development environment.
   3. Understand the original source code and add the desired functionality to the game.

#### **!Caution!**
    
   1. In Windows OS environments, the Windows.h header file runs well, but it may not work on other OS environments. 
   2. Compilation may not work properly, especially when running on Linux.
     +  Method 1. Interlink Vs-code with raspberrypi
     +  Method 2. Modifying console or Windows-related functions through the ncurses library on Linux
     +  Reference about method 2:
